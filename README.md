# belly-button-challenge

Hello there! 

Welcome to my belly button challenge! But not, /my/ belly button, but the code based on the belly button data provided in this course! 

I would like to preface by saying, as always, the naming conventions are the most fun I can have in these assignments so I name them kind of funny things. This module is based on Veggie Tales, there is a segment in the show called "Silly Songs with Larry", but this song in particular is a little more serious, a bit of a NSYNC parody. The song's name is [BellyButton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5uujMb_hbo) and is sung by the vegtable group known as, Boyz in the Sink. The naming conventions follow the group, their names, their band name, and things you might do to vegtables in real life such cleaning them or actions when making a mojito. I hope it makes you giggle today!

The code is forever written by me using course materials, troubleshooting with the class AI tool, but most importantly, I had help from my teachers, Mark and Alex. My labels and titles for my graphs weren't appearing, Mark was so kind as to point out that I needed to update the Plotly link on line 48 of my index.html file. He is to credit for the the labels. 

Please let me know if you have any issues, or have any questions. 
Thank you!
